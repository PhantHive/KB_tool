### Branches

- [x] [stable] - Stable branch (complete with start.sh)

### Purpose

It is a RTU school project where we want to be able to build a research tool for names.
The goal is to get the most relevant name for a given search in database.

### How to run

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies with `npm install`
- Run the script: you can start API and APP separately
using `npm start` in the API and APP folders respectively or using scripts `start_app.sh` and `start_api.sh`.
- Open your browser and go to `localhost:3000` to see the app running. You can also create a `.env` file in the API folder and add a **PORT** variable to change the port.

### Dependencies problems
- If you have problems with dependencies, try to update using `ncu -u` and then `npm install`
- Try to delete the `package-lock.json` file and then `npm install`

### Port issues
- In case you have a port already in use you can change it a .env file in the API folder and add a **PORT** variable to change the port.
- In case you started the app and you want to change the port, you can kill the process using `npx kill-port <number of port>` and then start the app again.
